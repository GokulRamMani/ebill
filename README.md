## Abstract <a name = "Abstract"></a>
The aim is to automate its existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation the same. Basically,the project describes how to manage for good performance and better services for the clients.

## Introduction
The electricity billing system has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardship faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data it also provides error messages while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system.

Thus by this, it proves it is a user-friendly electricity billing system, as described above, can lead to an error-free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities instead concentrate on record-keeping thus it will help organizations in better utilization of resources. Every organization, whether big or small has challenges to overcome and manage the information of unit energy, electricity, store record, connection, electricity board, and every electricity billing system.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you to develop the Electricity Billing System project in java using (GUI) Graphical User Interface, Java Swing and Java awt.

NetBeans Installation

NetBeans IDE is a free open - Source, Cross - plte from integrated Decelopment Environment with built-in support the JAVA programming language. it can run any machine which consists of the jva virtual machine. it consists of many features for application development as follows:
‚Ä¢Drag & Drop Graphical User Interface (GUI) Creation.

‚Ä¢Excellent editing (advanced source code editor)

‚Ä¢Web-service

‚Ä¢Excellent debugging

‚Ä¢Wizards, code generation and management tools, and many more.

Step 1: You need to have a setup file of the NetBeans JAVA into your setup.

Step 2: If you didn‚Äôt have the setup you can download from the following link:

https://netbeans.org/images_www/v6/download/community/8.2
